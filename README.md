## SSA Form - The unseen hero of modern compilers
Let’s take a deep look at the fabulous world of compilation to discover what an SSA Form is, or in other words: how modern compilers optimize binaries in the background?

The goal of this talk is to put a sense behind the word “optimization”, by giving you a big picture of those unseen low-level optimizations you are doing every day. This will also take you a step further from “It’s working but I don’t know why” to “It’s working and I know why”.
